**On "year" above:** "2004" reflects the year a description of Tilkin notation
was first published ([Bergeron 2004]: 157--172). The notation was created in
2002 ([Bergeron 2004]: 22).

</div>

Tilkin notation is described in full in Bergeron ([2004][Bergeron 2004]:
157--172), and only a shorter sample illustration is given in Bergeron
([2006][Bergeron 2006]). Tilkin himself have not published the system
([Bergeron 2006]: 24).

The entire description given by Bergeron ([2006][Bergeron 2006]: 7) is:

> With regard to writing systems, they differ from earlier systems in their aim
> of being used regularly by all speakers of a language, rather than solely by
> specialists. In this respect, these systems are comparable to the orthography
> of a spoken language. These systems are explicitly intended to create a
> written modality for a sign language and are developed with that purpose in
> mind. Some proposals, such as that of Gérald Tilkin (Tilkin, manuscript),
> attempt to use the same graphemes as those used for spoken language systems.
> For example, in Tilkin's system, the LSF sign for "écrire" ("to write", as
> illustrated in Moody, 1986) is written as: `s28dd+!F-l7`. The written form of
> this sign reflects the following elements:

> | `s28`: | Handshape /S/ (`s`); variant with the index finger extended (`2`); palm facing downward (`8`)|
> | `dd+`: | Straight movement repeated twice (double `d`); forward direction (`+`) |
> | `!F`:  | Contact from the dominant hand (`!`); with the other hand (`F`) |
> | `-`:   | Hand change |
> | `l7`:  | Non-dominant hand extended, fingers together (`l`); palm facing upward (`7`) |

> This system is composed of around sixty letters, numbers, and typographic
> symbols divided into seven groups:
>
> * Form-letters (18 letters, each representing a handshape);
> * Movement-letters (9 letters, each representing a type of hand movement);
> * Body-letters (6 letters, each representing a place of articulation);
> * Face-letters (12 letters, each representing a facial expression);
> * Direction-letters (6 characters, including 4 numbers and 2 typographic symbols, each representing a direction);
> * Part-letters (5 numbers which, when combined with body-letters, specify a part of the body);
> * "Other letters" (4 typographic symbols representing hand change, parallelism or symmetry of manual behaviors, or contact).
>
> In Tilkin's system, all associations between graphemes and what he calls
> 'gesture-parts' (that is, a chereme) are entirely arbitrary and have nothing
> to do with the shape of the graphemes or the shape of the cheremes.
