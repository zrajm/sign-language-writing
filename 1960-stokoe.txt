> The fifty-five symbols used in Stokoe's original script are based on the
> shapes of Latin letters, punctuation, and numbers. The script has not been
> standardized, and has been adapted for use with various signed languages, so
> some consider it a family of related scripts, rather than a single script.
> Stokoe dubbed the three types of symbols tab ("tabula" or sign location), dez
> ("designator" or handshape & orientation), and sig ("signification" or motion
> & action). Symbols are written in strict tab-dez-sig: TD^S^ order.

> Stokoe Notation has been criticized for not distinguishing between sharp and
> soft manner of movement or between tenseness and laxness, nor representing
> uneven rate of signing or facial expression, all of which are salient
> elements of ASL. The script is also not equipped to handle ASL pronouns.

The "Signed Swedish" part above is incorrect. Swedish sign language
transcription have been in the employ of proper Swedish Sign Language since the
beginning, though the confusion might have arisen from the fact that the book
that first proposed the Swedish version ([Bergman 1977]) is titled "Signed
Swedish", even though the author is scathingly critical of the practice of
using the spoken language syntax for sign language.
