[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg_Notation_System) says that
HamNoSys was created in 1984.

Below, both citations ([Miller 2001]) are slightly wrong: "Prillwitz &
Vollhaber 1989" refers to a whole book, but that volume in its entirety is not
included in Miller's reference section, which instead includes the relevant
article, Prillwitz & Zienert ([1990][Prillwitz & Zienert 1990]), found in the
same book. Also the publication year for "Prillwitz et al. 1990" should have
been listed as [1989][Prillwitz et al. 1989].

> This system, designed with the aim of applicability to the largest number of
> sign languages possible, attempts maximum iconicity in its inventory of
> symbols, including handshapes. It provides for detailed notation of point of
> contact on the non-dominant hand as well as for the notation of spatial
> locations. Provision is made for notation of nonmanuals. The system is
> available as a complete software package for the Macintosh operating system
> and a computer font for Windows. ([Miller 2001]: 16)
