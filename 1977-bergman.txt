*Bergman notation* was first described in Bergman ([1977][Bergman 1977]), and
has later been significantly updated and modified, first, by Wallin
([1994][Wallin 1994]), and, then, revised and simplified for broader
non-academic use when the official Swedish Sign Language Lexicon was first
published ([Hedberg 1997]). The transcription is still in use by the online
version of the dictionary ([Svenskt teckenspråkslexikon 2008]). The last guide
to its use is Bergman & Björkstrand ([2015][Bergman & Björkstrand 2015]).
There's also a Unicode font available online ([Zrajm 2017]).

Bergman notation borrows from Stokoe notation, but deviates is several aspects,
among other things it uses Swedish fingerspelling alphabet for the handshapes,
and features a more detailed attitude description ([Bergman 1977]: 90--92).

Renard ([2004][Renard 2004]) gives the creation year as 1979, but this is the
date of the publication of the English translation, not the original Swedish
Bergman ([1977][Bergman 1977]).
