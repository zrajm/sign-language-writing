*Bergman notation* was first described in Bergman ([1977][Bergman 1977]), and
has later been significantly updated and modified, first, by Wallin
([1994][Wallin 1994]), and, then, revised and simplified for broader
non-academic use when the official Swedish Sign Language Lexicon was first
published ([Hedberg 1997]). The transcription is still in use by the online
version of the dictionary ([Svenskt teckenspråkslexikon 2008]). The last guide
to its use is Bergman & Björkstrand ([2015][Bergman & Björkstrand 2015]).
There's also a Unicode font available online ([Zrajm 2017]).

The number of graphemes have varied over time, but font currently used by the
Swedish Sign Language Lexicon ([Svenskt teckenspråkslexikon 2008]) includes 40
locations symbols (including 5 diacritics), 40 handshapes, 12 attitude symbols,
41 motion symbols, 16 other symbols. Some of these symbols were requested by
the lexicon (when I designed the font) but is not (yet?) in use, such as symbol
for 'neutral position' (`U+10c9b3`), or Hedberg's more intuitive circular
motion glyphs (`U+10c9ae`, `U+10c9af` and `U+10c9b0`), or the 'bounce' motion
symbol (`U+10c9b6`). Wallin ([1994][Wallin 1994]) use a handful of handshape
symbols that are not included in the font, and the font also include an
experimental set of 'finger phonetics' symbols (for describing arbitrary
handshapes) that, to my knowledge, have never been used outside of my own
writing. ([Zrajm 2017]).

Bergman notation borrows from Stokoe notation, but deviates is several aspects,
among other things it uses Swedish fingerspelling alphabet for the handshapes,
and features a more detailed attitude description ([Bergman 1977]: 90--92).

Renard ([2004][Renard 2004]) gives the creation year as 1979, but this is the
date of the publication of the English translation, not the original Swedish
Bergman ([1977][Bergman 1977]).
