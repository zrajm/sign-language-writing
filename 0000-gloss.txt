Glossing is a common practice in sign language research and education. Signs
are typically represented by words from the spoken language, usually written in
all caps, and sometimes with other conventions to describe repetition,
direction or other sign language-only features. Glossing is often used when
teaching sign language to beginners to illustrate grammatical and syntactical
features of sign language.
