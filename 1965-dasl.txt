Title: DASL Notation (Dictionary of ASL Notation)
Latin: â—‘
Language: ASL
Country: United States
Creator: Stokoe, William C.; Casterline; Cronenberg
Source: Renard ([2004][Renard 2004]: 168)

FIXME: Renard classifies the Stokoe notation and DASL notation as two different
systems, however I think that's probably not true. I think DASL notation is a
minor development that should probably be described in the Stokoe notation
section, while this section should be removed. This section remains here until
that is verified, however.
