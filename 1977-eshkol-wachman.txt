According to [German Wikipedia:
"Gebärdenschrift"](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gebärdenschrift)
Eshkol-Wachmann created the Eshkol-Wachmann Movement Notation System for
Israeli Sign Language.

> One system which takes account of both manual and non-manual gesture is the
> Eshkol-Wachmann Movement Notation System which is used in *A New Dictionary
> of Sign Language* by Cohen, Namir and Schlesinger. The authors claim that
> with this system it is possible to provide a faithful reproduction and
> analysis of any sign and any bodily movement. As the system is primarily
> kinetic in that it is concerned with the physical properties of signing, it
> could be used as the basis for developing a linguistic description. However,
> the system is highly complex and if care is not taken such wealth of detail
> could confuse rather than clarify. ([Brennan 2004]: 26)
