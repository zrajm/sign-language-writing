**On "year" above:** It should be either 1998 or 1997. Barros ([2006][Barros
2006]) and Barros ([2008][Barros 2008]) give the year as "1997", while Barros
([2016][Barros 2016]), Portugese Wikipedia ("[Portugese Wikipedia: Mariângela
Estelita Barros]") and Google Scholar give it as "1998".---I have not been able
to obtain the dissertation, so consider the exact year unknown.

On the name "ELiS":

> ELiS is a writing system for LS [Sign Languages], with an alphabetic and
> linear basis. This system was created during my master's research in 1997,
> and since then it has been continuously refined based on suggestions from
> both deaf and hearing colleagues, as well as my own linguistic reflections.
> In fact, its name has evolved along with its theoretical development.
>
> It was originally called "AlfaSig" -- "Alfa" from "alphabetical" and "Sig"
> from the Latin "signalis". However, upon realizing the close association of
> "alfa," or "alphabetical," with a representation of sounds, I discarded the
> name. It was then called "QuiroSig," as the system represents the "quiremas"
> [chiremes] of signs, according to the terminology created by Stokoe. During
> the pilot study, however, the teacher of the class in which I served as a
> researcher noticed that the name lacked a reference to "writing" and referred
> only to "signs." For a period, the system was called ScripSig. It was later
> renamed again and is now simply and definitively presented as ELiS, an
> acronym for Escrita das Línguas de Sinais [writing of sign languages]. The
> structure of ELiS that I present here is from 2007. ([Barros 2008]: 25,

It is a linear, horizontal, left-to-right system. It emphasizes simplicity and has a computer font. It has 95 characters and is adaptable for various sign languages
| Estimates for numbers of users today | Utilised and disseminated by several Brazilian universities (UFG, UFGD, UFMT). It is considered one of the "most promising systems" in Brazil
