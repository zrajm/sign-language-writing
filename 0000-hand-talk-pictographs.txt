Title: Hand Talk Pictographs

Language: PISL(?)

I have on several occasions encountered mentions of a pictograph style of sign
language writing used for PISL (Farnell [1995][Farnell 1995]: 244--247, Graber
[2018][Graber 2018]), which seems to often be combined with more logographic
writing.---It is not clear to me how complete this system of writing is, but I
would be greatly amiss if I did not include it on this list.

Graber ([2018][Graber 2018]) describes the shape and meaning of some of these
symbols, as used in a letter in 1890, but, unfortunately, she does not compare
the symbols directly to the corresponding signs in PISL.

> [...] A circle followed by four loops signifies four brothers. Three
> horizontal lines stand for the number three. A box with vertical lines,
> followed by a swooping downward and then upward line, means that someone has
> been buried in a grave. Together, the signs tell Cozad that he no longer had
> four brothers, but only three. One had recently died and been buried.

> circle in Schoolcraft [1851--1857][Schoolcraft 1851--1857], vol. 1, pp. 390,
> 407; RIVER in Schoolcraft [1851--1857][Schoolcraft 1851--1857], vol. 2, plate
> 57; TRADE in Mallery [1886][Mallery 1886]:220). A good example of a message
> written using pictographs of this kind and written by an Assiniboine person
> can be found in Denig [[1930][Denig 1961]] 1961:603.

> Further examples of pictographs representing the movement paths of signs are
> described in Mallery [1886][Mallery 1886]:219--221 and
> [1893][Mallery 1893]:639--641, e.g., PIPE, HUNGER, LITTLE CHIEF, DAKOTA,
> NOON. The only two exceptions to this I have encountered to date are (a) a
> seated human figure signifying "pipe" in which the Dakota artist drew a tiny
> human figure making the sign PIPE instead of drawing a pipe (see Batiste
> Goode's winter count in Mallery [1886][Mallery 1886]:219); and (b) "Afraid of
> Him" a name sign in Red Cloud's census that shows the handshape and arm
> position from the sign AFRAID (Mallery [1886][Mallery 1886]:639). It is
> interesting to note in passing that Dakota pictographs of persons who were
> prisoners are depicted without hands to denote helplessness (Mallery
> [1886][Mallery 1886]:242).
