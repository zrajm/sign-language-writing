Year: 1980
Title: Corazza Notation
Latin: â—• (mostly alphabetical, some funny diacritics)
Language: LIS
Country: Italy
Creator: Corazza, Serena
Source: Renard ([2004][Renard 2004]: 168),
        Miller ([2001][Miller 2001])

Derived from Stokoe notation according to Renard ([2004][Renard 2004]). Derived
from the Berkeley group (in turned derived from DASL), together with [Radutzky
notation] according to Miller ([2001][Miller 2001]).

...I'm not 100% sure this counts as a complete notation system, as Corazza
([1990][Corazza 1990]) only give examples for classifiers.

> I use the notational system adopted for LIS in Corazza et al.
> ([1985][Corazza 1985]) and Volterra ([1986][Volterra 1987]). ([Corazza 1990])
