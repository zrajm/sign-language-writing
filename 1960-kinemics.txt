Not derived from Stokoe notation according to Renard ([2004][Renard 2004]:
168).

The Kiremics system used by West ([1960][West 1960]) is quite unique. Symbols
are borrowed from both the Latin alphabet and other, phonetic alphabets. There
is no correspondence between a fingerspelling and the symbols used---instead
West assigns symbols by analogy the consonant charts used for spoken languages
letting the place of articulation (labial, alveo-dental, prepalatal, palatal
etc.) stand in for hand placement, and when writing hand shapes, also which
fingers unfolded/salient.

For example, the symbol ‹k› is described as "hand extended, but relaxed, ulnar
edge (little finger or right edge) active and salient"---including not only
handshape, but also which part of the hand is active/salient in its use.

> The number of kinemes charted above ie 66: 18 hand shapes, 40 referents and 8
> directions. The number of different symbols utilized to notate these 66
> kinemes is 39: 34 basic alphabetic symbols and 5 diacritics. ([West 1960]:
> 20)
