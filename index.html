# Sign Language Writing

> This is an overview of all sign language writing systems I've been able to
> find in the literature. They range from systems that only use the Latin
> alphabet, to systems with a completely novel symbol inventory, and from
> detailed transcription systems for scientific use, to writing systems
> intended for everyday use.

Glossing is a common practice in sign language research and education. Signs
are typically represented by words from the spoken language, usually written in
all caps, and sometimes with other conventions to describe repetition,
direction or other sign language-only features. Glossing is often used when
teaching sign language to beginners to illustrate grammatical and syntactical
features of sign language.

I have on several occasions encountered mentions of a pictograph style of sign
language writing used by native Americans for PISL (Farnell [1995][Farnell
1995]: 244--247, Graber [2018][Graber 2018]), which seems to often be mixed
with more logographic symbols as well.---It is not clear to me how complete
this system of writing is, but I would be greatly amiss if I did not include it
on this list.

Graber ([2018][Graber 2018]) describes the shape and meaning of some of these
symbols, as used in a letter in 1890, but, unfortunately, she does not compare
the symbols directly to the corresponding signs in PISL.

> [...] A circle followed by four loops signifies four brothers. Three
> horizontal lines stand for the number three. A box with vertical lines,
> followed by a swooping downward and then upward line, means that someone has
> been buried in a grave. Together, the signs tell Cozad that he no longer had
> four brothers, but only three. One had recently died and been buried.

> Some caution is indeed necessary when dealing with Tomkins' treatment of

> ([1926][Tomkins 1926]:89), and he may have taken this idea from Dakota winter
> counts (see Mallery [1886][Mallery 1886] for examples). Most of the
> pictographic "building blocks" used by Tomkins can also be found in the more
> scholarly collections of Schoolcraft and Mallery, however (e.g., SKY as half
> circle in Schoolcraft [1851--1857][Schoolcraft 1851--1857], vol. 1, pp. 390,
> 407; RIVER in Schoolcraft [1851--1857][Schoolcraft 1851--1857], vol. 2, plate
> 57; TRADE in Mallery [1886][Mallery 1886]:220). A good example of a message
> written using pictographs of this kind and written by an Assiniboine person
> can be found in Denig [[1930][Denig 1961]] 1961:603.
>
> Further examples of pictographs representing the movement paths of signs are
> described in Mallery [1886][Mallery 1886]:219--221 and
> [1893][Mallery 1893]:639--641, e.g., PIPE, HUNGER, LITTLE CHIEF, DAKOTA,
> NOON. The only two exceptions to this I have encountered to date are (a) a
> seated human figure signifying "pipe" in which the Dakota artist drew a tiny
> human figure making the sign PIPE instead of drawing a pipe (see Batiste
> Goode's winter count in Mallery [1886][Mallery 1886]:219); and (b) "Afraid of
> Him" a name sign in Red Cloud's census that shows the handshape and arm
> position from the sign AFRAID (Mallery [1886][Mallery 1886]:639). It is
> interesting to note in passing that Dakota pictographs of persons who were
> prisoners are depicted without hands to denote helplessness (Mallery
> [1886][Mallery 1886]:242).

Not derived from Stokoe notation according to Renard ([2004][Renard 2004]:
168).

The Kiremics system used by West ([1960][West 1960]) is quite unique. Symbols
are borrowed from both the Latin alphabet and other, phonetic alphabets. There
is no correspondence between a fingerspelling and the symbols used---instead
West assigns symbols by analogy the consonant charts used for spoken languages
letting the place of articulation (labial, alveo-dental, prepalatal, palatal
etc.) stand in for hand placement, and when writing hand shapes, also which
fingers unfolded/salient.

For example, the symbol ‹k› is described as "hand extended, but relaxed, ulnar
edge (little finger or right edge) active and salient"---including not only
handshape, but also which part of the hand is active/salient in its use.

> The number of kinemes charted above ie 66: 18 hand shapes, 40 referents and 8
> directions. The number of different symbols utilized to notate these 66
> kinemes is 39: 34 basic alphabetic symbols and 5 diacritics. ([West 1960]:

[Bergman Notation]: #bergman
## [#bergman] 1977: Bergman Notation

<details class="hanging summary"><summary>

**Year:** 1977

**Title:** Bergman Notation

**Latin:** ◑ (alphabetical symbols for handshapes, many novel symbols & diacritics)

**Language:** STS

**Country:** Sweden

**Creator:** Bergman, Brita (hearing)

<div></div>

*Bergman notation* was first described in Bergman ([1977][Bergman 1977]), and
has later been significantly updated and modified, first, by Wallin
([1994][Wallin 1994]), and, then, revised and simplified for broader
non-academic use when the official Swedish Sign Language Lexicon was first
published ([Hedberg 1997]). The transcription is still in use by the online
version of the dictionary ([Svenskt teckenspråkslexikon 2008]). The last guide
to its use is Bergman & Björkstrand ([2015][Bergman & Björkstrand 2015]).
There's also a Unicode font available online ([Zrajm 2017]).

The number of graphemes have varied over time, but font currently used by the
Swedish Sign Language Lexicon ([Svenskt teckenspråkslexikon 2008]) includes 40
locations symbols (including 5 diacritics), 40 handshapes, 12 attitude symbols,
41 motion symbols, 16 other symbols. Some of these symbols were requested by
the lexicon (when I designed the font) but is not (yet?) in use, such as symbol
for 'neutral position' (`U+10c9b3`), or Hedberg's more intuitive circular
motion glyphs (`U+10c9ae`, `U+10c9af` and `U+10c9b0`), or the 'bounce' motion
symbol (`U+10c9b6`). Wallin ([1994][Wallin 1994]) use a handful of handshape
symbols that are not included in the font, and the font also include an
experimental set of 'finger phonetics' symbols (for describing arbitrary
handshapes) that, to my knowledge, have never been used outside of my own
writing. ([Zrajm 2017]).

Bergman notation borrows from Stokoe notation, but deviates is several aspects,
among other things it uses Swedish fingerspelling alphabet for the handshapes,
and features a more detailed attitude description ([Bergman 1977]: 90--92).

Renard ([2004][Renard 2004]) gives the creation year as 1979, but this is the
date of the publication of the English translation, not the original Swedish
Bergman ([1977][Bergman 1977]).

| Country | France (INJS de Paris)

| Creator | Brenda Farnell developed the system to encompass sign language, based on Drid Williams the anthropological use of Labanotation for describing general movement, which in turn came from the choreography writing an analysis developed by Rudolf von Laban in the 1920s.
| Year |1995 (when it was first used for sign language).

| Estimates for numbers of users today | Used for choreographic and academic purposes; not designed or widely used for everyday sign language communication

Not derived from Stokoe notation according to Renard ([2004][Renard 2004]),
which also gives 1980 as the creation year of Farnell Labanotation.

Renard also lists a notation called *Laban-Benesh Labanotation* (1969) -- But I
think this notation (like the original Labanotation) is meant for choreography,
not sign language. (FIXME: verify this)

<div></div>

[Labanotation][Wikipedia Labanotation] was first developed by the Rudolf von
Laban in 1920s to write dance movement ([von Laban 1928]). Drid Williams later
used the system in her anthropological studies (FIXME: reference), but it was
Williams student, Brenda Farnell who adapted it for writing for sign language,
and put it to use in describing *Plains Indian Sign Language* (PISL) ([Farnell
1995]).

> It was originally called "AlfaSig" -- "Alfa" from "alphabetical" and "Sig"
> from the Latin "signalis". However, upon realizing the close association of
> "alfa," or "alphabetical," with a representation of sounds, I discarded the
> name. It was then called "QuiroSig," as the system represents the "quiremas"
> [chiremes] of signs, according to the terminology created by Stokoe. During
> the pilot study, however, the teacher of the class in which I served as a
> researcher noticed that the name lacked a reference to "writing" and referred
> only to "signs." For a period, the system was called ScripSig. It was later
> renamed again and is now simply and definitively presented as ELiS, an
