# Gloss and Latin-Based Systems

This category includes systems that primarily use letters from the Latin
alphabet or words (glosses) to represent signs, even if those letters are
assigned arbitrary or non-phonetic meanings specific to the sign language
context.


[Gloss]: #gloss
## Gloss


* **Inventor(s)**: Not attributed to a single inventor; it is a long-standing
  conventional practice. FIXME
* **Year of creation**: No specific date is given, but it has been "used for
  years" in studying and teaching American Sign Language (ASL). FIXME
* **Country of origin**: Not explicitly stated, but its use in "ASL textbooks"
  and focus on ASL grammar implies a **USA** context. FIXME
* **Sign language(s) created for/can be used for**: Primarily used for
  **American Sign Language (ASL)**, but serves as a general method for
  representing signs across various signed languages in research. It uses
  English words (conventionally in capital letters) to represent signs. FIXME
* **Estimates for numbers of users today**: It is **not typically used for
  personal written communication**. Its primary use is in **linguistic analysis
  and teaching** to facilitate discussions about sign language grammar. FIXME
* **Certainty of data**: High regarding its purpose and non-personal use;
  specific user numbers are not available. FIXME


[ASL Orthography]: #asl-orthography
## [#asl-orthography] 1997: ASL Orthography

* **Inventor(s)**: **Travis Low** (a hearing computer programmer and ASL
  student). FIXME

* **Country of origin**: Not explicitly stated, but implied as **USA** due to
  its focus on ASL. FIXME
* **Sign language(s) created for/can be used for**: Developed to aid the
  inventor's learning of **American Sign Language (ASL)**. It is based on
  **ASCII characters** (including upper-case letters and numbers). FIXME
* **Estimates for numbers of users today**: Information about its use is
  **scarce and incomplete**. It was intended for personal use. FIXME
* **Certainty of data**: Low. FIXME


[FBL Notation]: #fbl
## [#fbl] 1995: Ferreira-Brito-Langevin Notation (Notação de Ferreira-Brito-Langevin)

* FIXME: When was this first published? 1994? 1995?

* **Inventor(s)**: **Lucinda Ferreira Brito** and **Rémi Langevin**. FIXME
* **Year of creation**: **1995**. FIXME
* **Country of origin**: **Brazil** (Lucinda Ferreira Brito, Federal University
  of Rio de Janeiro) and **France** (Rémi Langevin, University of Burgundy). FIXME
* **Sign language(s) created for/can be used for**: Developed for **Libras
  (Brazilian Sign Language)**, particularly for creating a dictionary. It uses
  **alphanumeric characters** and is described as being of an "alphabetic
  type". It is adaptable for various sign languages. FIXME
* **Estimates for numbers of users today**: Primarily used for **academic and
  scientific notation**. FIXME
* **Certainty of data**: High regarding its academic use; low for widespread
  daily use. FIXME


[Nève Notation]: #neve
## [#neve] 1996: Nève Notation (Notation des Gestèmes)

Also called *Gesteme Notation* (or "Notation des Gestèmes").

* **Inventor(s)**: **François-Xavier Nève** (a hearing professor). FIXME
* **Year of creation**: **1996**. FIXME
* **Country of origin**: **Belgium** (University of Liège). FIXME
* **Sign language(s) created for/can be used for**: Designed for **LSFB (French
  Belgian Sign Language)**. It uses **ASCII characters** (letters, numbers, and
  non-alphanumeric characters) for numeric coding and non-linear computerised
  organisation of signs. It is oriented vertically in columns. FIXME
* **Estimates for numbers of users today**: Primarily used for **academic and
  scientific notation**. FIXME
* **Certainty of data**: High regarding its academic use; low for widespread
  daily use. FIXME


[SLIPA]: #slipa
## [#slipa] 2000(?): SLIPA (Sign Language International Phonetic Alphabet)

* FIXME: When was this first published? 2000? 2006?

* **Inventor(s)**: **David Peterson**. FIXME
* **Year of creation**: **2000**. FIXME
* **Country of origin**: Not explicitly stated, but it is designed as an "IPA
  for Signed Languages", suggesting an international application. FIXME
* **Sign language(s) created for/can be used for**: Primarily intended for
  **transcription** of any signed language, rather than as an everyday
  orthography. It is composed of **Latin alphabet letters, numerals, and Arabic
  numerals** (ASCII characters). It is adaptable for various sign languages. FIXME
* **Estimates for numbers of users today**: Used for **recreational and
  academic** purposes. FIXME
* **Certainty of data**: High for its intended purpose; low for widespread
  daily use. FIXME


[ASLSJ]: #aslsj
## [#aslsj] 2009: ASLSJ (ASL Sign Jotting)

* **Year of creation**: **2009**. FIXME
* **Country of origin**: Not explicitly stated, but the name implies **USA**. FIXME
* **Sign language(s) created for/can be used for**: **American Sign Language
  (ASL)**. It is designed to allow a variable degree of ambiguity, relying on
  the reader's existing ASL knowledge. It utilises **ASCII characters**. FIXME
* **Estimates for numbers of users today**: Intended for **dictionary and
  personal use**. FIXME
* **Certainty of data**: High for its intended purpose; low for widespread
  adoption. FIXME


[Séro-Guillaume Writing]: #sero-guillaume
## [#sero-guillaume] 2014: Alphabetic Writing of Philippe Séro-Guillaume (L'écriture alphabétique de Philippe Séro-Guillaume)

* **Inventor(s)**: **Philippe Séro-Guillaume** (a linguist). FIXME
* **Year of creation**: **2014**. FIXME
* **Country of origin**: **France**. FIXME
* **Sign language(s) created for/can be used for**: Proposed for **French Sign
  Language (LSF)**. It aims to write signs using the **"current alphabet"
  (Latin alphabet)**, assigning typographic signs to represent the five
  parameters of signs. FIXME
* **Estimates for numbers of users today**: This is a **recent proposal**, and
  its adoption or widespread use is not detailed in the sources. FIXME
* **Certainty of data**: Low. FIXME


[Tilkin Notation]: #tilkin
## [#tilkin] 2006: Tilkin Notation

This is an alphanumerical system, briefly illustrated with an example sign in
[Bergeron \(2006: 7\)][Bergeron 2006]---and the references in the same source
also states that Tilkin's manuscript in unpublished.

* **Inventor(s)**: **Gérald Tilkin**.
* **Year of creation**: Unsure, but Bergeron mentions it in the year 2006.
* **Country of origin**: Not explicitly stated, but the example provided is
  from **French Sign Language (LSF)**.
* **Sign language(s) created for/can be used for**: Proposed for **LSF**. It
  seeks to use the "same graphemes as the systems for oral languages,"
  employing **alphanumeric characters** with arbitrary associations to sign
  components.
* **Estimates for numbers of users today**: Not specified, likely an academic
  proposal not intended for or widely adopted for everyday use.

> With regard to writing systems, they differ from earlier systems in their aim
> of being used regularly by all speakers of a language, rather than solely by
> specialists. In this respect, these systems are comparable to the orthography
> of a spoken language. These systems are explicitly intended to create a
> written modality for a sign language and are developed with that purpose in
> mind. Some proposals, such as that of Gérald Tilkin (Tilkin, manuscript),
> attempt to use the same graphemes as those used for spoken language systems.
> For example, in Tilkin's system, the LSF sign for "écrire" ("to write", as
> illustrated in Moody, 1986) is written as: `s28dd+!F-l7`. The written form of
> this sign reflects the following elements:

> | `-`:   | Hand change |
> | `l7`:  | Non-dominant hand extended, fingers together (`l`); palm facing upward (`7`) |

>
> This system is composed of around sixty letters, numbers, and typographic
> symbols divided into seven groups:
>
> * Form-letters (18 letters, each representing a handshape);
> * Movement-letters (9 letters, each representing a type of hand movement);
> * Body-letters (6 letters, each representing a place of articulation);
> * Face-letters (12 letters, each representing a facial expression);
> * Direction-letters (6 characters, including 4 numbers and 2 typographic symbols, each representing a direction);
> * Part-letters (5 numbers which, when combined with body-letters, specify a part of the body);
> * "Other letters" (4 typographic symbols representing hand change, parallelism or symmetry of manual behaviors, or contact).
>
> In Tilkin's system, all associations between graphemes and what he calls
> 'gesture-parts' (that is, a chereme) are entirely arbitrary and have nothing
> to do with the shape of the graphemes or the shape of the cheremes.

  horizontal, while isolated signs are grouped vertically. It uses "exclusive"
  (unique) characters. FIXME
* **Estimates for numbers of users today**: Described as "currently operational
  in France" and is taught through organised stages. FIXME

[Farnell Labanotation]: #farnell
## [#farnell] 1995: Farnell Labanotation

[Labanotation][Wikipedia Labanotation] was first developed by the Rudolf von
Laban in 1920s to writing dance movement ([von Laban 1928]). Drid Williams
later used the system in her anthropological studies (FIXME: reference).

But it was Williams student, Brenda Farnell who adapted it for writing for sign
language, and put it to use in describing *Plains Indian Sign Language* (PISL)
([Farnell 1995]).

* **Inventor(s)**: **Brenda Farnell** developed the system to encompass sign
  language, based on **Drid Williams** the anthropological use of Labanotation
  for describing general movement, which in turn came from the choreography
  writing an analysis developed by **Rudolf von Laban** in the 1920s.
* **Year of creation**: **1995** (when it was first used for sign language).
* **Country of origin**: Not explicitly stated, Laban was Austro-Hungarian. FIXME
* **Sign language(s) created for/can be used for**: Primarily a **dance
  notation** system, but referenced for its adaptability or influence on sign
  language notation. It uses its own **iconic symbols** for movement. FIXME
* **Estimates for numbers of users today**: Used for choreographic and academic
  purposes; **not designed or widely used for everyday sign language
  communication**. FIXME
* **Certainty of data**: High for its existence as dance notation; less certain
  for direct, widespread sign language use beyond academic transcription. FIXME


[West Notation]: #west
## [#west] 1960: La Mont West's system

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Mont_West

* **Inventor(s)**: **La Mont West Jr.**.
* **Year of creation**: **1960** (as part of his PhD thesis).
* **Country of origin**: **USA** (Indiana University).
* **Sign language(s) created for/can be used for**: Developed for **Plains
  Indian Sign Language**. It uses a combination of "printed letters and a few
  symbols borrowed from phonetic transcription of oral languages" to represent
  sign parameters.
* **Estimates for numbers of users today**: It "received little attention" and
  had "practically no influence" on other researchers. FIXME
* **Certainty of data**: Low. FIXME


[IVT Notation]: #ivt
## [#ivt] 1989: International Visual Théâtre (IVT)

* **Inventor(s)**: A **group of French Deaf individuals**. FIXME
* **Year of creation**: **1980**. FIXME
* **Country of origin**: **France**. FIXME
* **Sign language(s) created for/can be used for**: Not explicitly stated, but
  implied for **French Sign Language (LSF)** due to its origin. It is described
  as a "notation". FIXME
* **Estimates for numbers of users today**: Appears to be a **by-product of
  studies for their dictionaries**. It is "quickly presented" during workshops
  but is **not systematically taught or published** in their dictionaries. FIXME
* **Certainty of data**: Low. FIXME

[SBM Notation]: #sbm
## [#sbm] 1994: Signographie Boyer-Haouam (SBM)

* **Inventor(s)**: **Philippe Boyer** and **Nadia Haouam** (Deaf teachers). FIXME
* **Year of creation**: **1994** (when Haouam was trained and the method
  developed). Boyer's research on the system started between 1990--1995. FIXME
* **Country of origin**: **France** (INJS de Paris). FIXME
* **Sign language(s) created for/can be used for**: Developed for **French Sign
  Language (LSF)**. It uses **simple geometric figures for facial expressions**
  and draws some inspiration from **Chinese ideograms for hand
  configurations**. It notes facial expressions and gaze orientation. It aims
  to be fluid and fast like written French. It is claimed it can write "any
  sign of any country". FIXME
* **Estimates for numbers of users today**: Described as the **"only method of
  writing signs used in teaching in France"** in specialised schools (e.g.,
  INJS de Paris). FIXME
* **Certainty of data**: High for its use in specialised education in France. FIXME


[Bergman Notation]: #bergman
## [#bergman] 1977: Bergman Notation

* **Inventor(s)**: A committee established by the **Swedish National
  Association of the Deaf**. Research was conducted by **Brita Bergman**. FIXME
* **Year of creation**: The committee was set up in **1970**. A sign dictionary
  was published in 1971 and 1973. FIXME
* **Country of origin**: **Sweden**. FIXME
* **Sign language(s) created for/can be used for**: A constructed language,
  **Signed Swedish**, which is adapted to Swedish and is distinct from Swedish
  Sign Language (SSL). It is a "cheremic" system (one chereme-one graphic
  symbol). As a derivative of Stokoe Notation, it is implied to incorporate
  **iconic symbols** for handshapes and movements. FIXME
* **Estimates for numbers of users today**: Aims to help Deaf children learn to
  read and write Swedish. While presented as a "definite asset for future sign
  dictionaries and manuals," it has been commonly perceived as "too hard to
  learn". FIXME
* **Certainty of data**: High for its existence and academic study; lower for
  widespread active adoption as an everyday writing system. FIXME
