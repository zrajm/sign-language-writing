# Sign Language Writing

> This is an overview of all sign language writing systems I've been able to
> find in the literature. They range from systems that only use the Latin
> alphabet, to systems with a completely novel symbol inventory, and from
> detailed transcription systems for scientific use, to writing systems
> intended for everyday use.

# Gloss and Latin-Based Systems

This category includes systems that primarily use letters from the Latin
alphabet or words (glosses) to represent signs, even if those letters are
assigned arbitrary or non-phonetic meanings specific to the sign language
context.


[Gloss]: #gloss
## Gloss

| Year     | --                 |
| Creator  | --                 |
| Country  | Any                |
| Language | All                |
| Use      | Transcription      |
| Script   | Latin symbols only |

Glossing is a common practice in sign language research and education. Signs
are typically represented by words from the spoken language, usually written in
all caps, and sometimes with other conventions to describe repetition,
direction or other sign language-only features. In glossing is often used in
education to illustrate grammatical features and syntax.


[ASL Orthography]: #asl-orthography
## [#asl-orthography] 1997: ASL Orthography

| Year     | 1997                 |
| Creator  | Travis Low (hearing) |
| Country  | USA                  |
| Language | ASL                  |
| Use      | Personal             |
| Script   | Latin symbols only   |

A simple system for writing ASL using only ASCII characters. Created by Travis
Low in 1997 ([ASL Font 2021], [Cardoso 2023], [Mendes 2020]) and intended to be
used for everyday writing, rather than academic research or transcription ([Low
1997]).


[FBL Notation]: #fbl
## [#fbl] 1995: Ferreira-Brito-Langevin Notation (Notação de Ferreira-Brito-Langevin)

* (FIXME: Verify! Also: Were Ferreira Brito and Langevin deaf or hearing?)

| Year     | 1995                                                                                                     |
| Creator  | Ferreira Brito, Lucinda (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) & Langevin, Rémi (University of Burgundy) |
| Country  | Brazil & France                                                                                          |
| Language | Libras                                                                                                   |
| Use      | Developed for a dictionary                                                                               |
| Script   | Latin symbols only                                                                                       |


[Nève Notation]: #neve
## [#neve] 1996: Nève Notation (Notation des Gestèmes)

Also called *Gesteme Notation* (or "Notation des Gestèmes").

* (FIXME: Verify!)

| Year |1996
| Creator | François-Xavier Nève (a hearing professor) |
| Country | Belgium (University of Liège)
| Language | Designed for LSFB. It uses ASCII characters (letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters) for numeric coding and non-linear computerised organisation of signs. It is oriented vertically in columns
| Estimates for numbers of users today | Primarily used for academic and scientific notation

Not derived from Stokoe notation according to Renard.

Renard (2004: 65--70).


[SLIPA]: #slipa
## [#slipa] 2000(?): SLIPA (Sign Language International Phonetic Alphabet)

* FIXME: When was this first published? 2000? 2006?

* (FIXME: Verify!)

| Year |2000
| Creator | David J. Peterson |
| Country | Not explicitly stated, but it is designed as an "IPA for Signed Languages", suggesting an international application
| Language | Primarily intended for transcription of any signed language, rather than as an everyday orthography. It is composed of Latin alphabet letters, numerals, and Arabic numerals (ASCII characters). It is adaptable for various sign languages
| Estimates for numbers of users today | Used for recreational and academic purposes


[ASLSJ]: #aslsj
## [#aslsj] 2009: ASLSJ (ASL Sign Jotting)

* (FIXME: Verify!)

| Year |2009
| Creator | Thomas Stone |
| Country | Not explicitly stated, but the name implies USA
| Language | ASL. It is designed to allow a variable degree of ambiguity, relying on the reader's existing ASL knowledge. It utilises ASCII characters
| Estimates for numbers of users today | Intended for dictionary and personal use


[Séro-Guillaume Writing]: #sero-guillaume
## [#sero-guillaume] 2014: Alphabetic Writing of Philippe Séro-Guillaume (L'écriture alphabétique de Philippe Séro-Guillaume)

* (FIXME: Verify!)

| Year |2014
| Creator | Philippe Séro-Guillaume (a linguist) |
| Country | France
| Language | Proposed for LSF. It aims to write signs using the "current alphabet" (Latin alphabet), assigning typographic signs to represent the five parameters of signs
| Estimates for numbers of users today | This is a recent proposal, and its adoption or widespread use is not detailed in the sources

Not derived from Stokoe notation according to Renard.

Renard (2004: 142--143).


[Tilkin Notation]: #tilkin
## [#tilkin] 2006: Tilkin Notation

This is an alphanumerical system, briefly illustrated with an example sign in
Bergeron ([2006][Bergeron 2006]: 7)---and the references in the same source
also states that Tilkin's manuscript in unpublished.

| Year |Unsure, but Bergeron mentions it in the year 2006.
| Creator | Gérald Tilkin
| Country | Not explicitly stated, but the example provided is from LSF.
| Language | Proposed for LSF. It seeks to use the "same graphemes as the systems for oral languages," employing alphanumeric characters with arbitrary associations to sign components.
| Estimates for numbers of users today | Not specified, likely an academic proposal not intended for or widely adopted for everyday use.

> With regard to writing systems, they differ from earlier systems in their aim
> of being used regularly by all speakers of a language, rather than solely by
> specialists. In this respect, these systems are comparable to the orthography
> of a spoken language. These systems are explicitly intended to create a
> written modality for a sign language and are developed with that purpose in
> mind. Some proposals, such as that of Gérald Tilkin (Tilkin, manuscript),
> attempt to use the same graphemes as those used for spoken language systems.
> For example, in Tilkin's system, the LSF sign for "écrire" ("to write", as
> illustrated in Moody, 1986) is written as: `s28dd+!F-l7`. The written form of
> this sign reflects the following elements:

> | `s28`: | Handshape /S/ (`s`); variant with the index finger extended (`2`); palm facing downward (`8`)|
> | `dd+`: | Straight movement repeated twice (double `d`); forward direction (`+`) |
> | `!F`:  | Contact from the dominant hand (`!`); with the other hand (`F`) |
> | `-`:   | Hand change |
> | `l7`:  | Non-dominant hand extended, fingers together (`l`); palm facing upward (`7`) |
>
> </figure>
>
> This system is composed of around sixty letters, numbers, and typographic
> symbols divided into seven groups:
>
> * Form-letters (18 letters, each representing a handshape);
> * Movement-letters (9 letters, each representing a type of hand movement);
> * Body-letters (6 letters, each representing a place of articulation);
> * Face-letters (12 letters, each representing a facial expression);
> * Direction-letters (6 characters, including 4 numbers and 2 typographic symbols, each representing a direction);
> * Part-letters (5 numbers which, when combined with body-letters, specify a part of the body);
> * "Other letters" (4 typographic symbols representing hand change, parallelism or symmetry of manual behaviors, or contact).
>
> In Tilkin's system, all associations between graphemes and what he calls
> 'gesture-parts' (that is, a chereme) are entirely arbitrary and have nothing
> to do with the shape of the graphemes or the shape of the cheremes.

[ASCII-Stokoe Notation]: #ascii-stokoe
## [#ascii-stokoe] 1993: ASCII-Stokoe Notation

FIXME


# Non-Latin Systems

This category includes any system that uses one or more glyphs or characters
developed specifically for representing sign language features, which are not
part of the standard Latin alphabet. This includes iconic, pictographic, or
unique abstract symbols. FIXME


[Stokoe Notation]: #stokoe
## [#stokoe] 1960: Stokoe Notation

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokoe_notation

* (FIXME: Verify!)

| Year |The initial system was developed in 1960. A dictionary based on linguistic principles was published in 1965
| Creator | William Stokoe, with D. Casterline & C. Croneberg
| Country | USA (Gallaudet University)
| Language | Primarily for ASL. It uses letters and numbers for handshapes, combined with conventionalised iconic symbols for location, movement, and spatial relations. It has been adapted and extended for other sign languages, such as BSL and STS
| Estimates for numbers of users today | Predominantly used by linguists and researchers for phonological analysis. It is one of the most widely used notation systems in academic research

Renard (2004: 59--64).

[Farnell Labanotation]: #farnell
## [#farnell] 1995: Farnell Labanotation

* (FIXME: Verify!)

| Creator | Brenda Farnell developed the system to encompass sign language, based on Drid Williams the anthropological use of Labanotation for describing general movement, which in turn came from the choreography writing an analysis developed by Rudolf von Laban in the 1920s.
| Year |1995 (when it was first used for sign language).
| Country | Not explicitly stated, Laban was Austro-Hungarian
| Language | Primarily a dance notation system, but referenced for its adaptability or influence on sign language notation. It uses its own iconic symbols for movement
| Estimates for numbers of users today | Used for choreographic and academic purposes; not designed or widely used for everyday sign language communication

Not derived from Stokoe notation according to Renard. Renard gives 1980 as the
creation year of Farnell Labanotation. Renard also lists a notation called
*Laban-Benesh Labanotation* (1969) -- but I think this notation (like the
original Labanotation) is meant for choreography, not sign language. (FIXME:
verify this)

<div></div>

[Labanotation][Wikipedia Labanotation] was first developed by the Rudolf von
Laban in 1920s to writing dance movement ([von Laban 1928]). Drid Williams
later used the system in her anthropological studies (FIXME: reference).

But it was Williams student, Brenda Farnell who adapted it for writing for sign
language, and put it to use in describing *Plains Indian Sign Language* (PISL)
([Farnell 1995]).

| Script   |                                        |

This is a placeholder entry. Renard classifies the Stokoe notation and DASL
notation as two different systems. But I think this is probably not true. I
think DASL notation is a minor development that should probably be described in
the Stokoe notation section, while this section should be removed. This section
remains here until that is verified, however.

| Use      | Transcription                                 |
| Script   | Latin based, with custom symbols & diacritics |

*Bergman notation* was first published in Bergman ([1977][Bergman 1977]), it
was later significantly expanded by Wallin ([1994][Wallin 1994]), and then
revised and simplified somewhat for broader non-academic use when the official
Swedish Sign Language Lexicon was first published ([Hedberg 1997]). The
transcription is still in use by the online version of the dictionary ([Svenskt
teckenspråkslexikon 2008]). The last guide to its use is Bergman & Björkstrand
([2015][Bergman & Björkstrand 2015]). There's also a Unicode font available
online ([Zrajm 2017]).

Bergman notation borrows a lot from Stokoe notation, but deviates is several
aspects, among other things it uses Swedish fingerspelling alphabet for (most
of) the hand shapes, and features a more detailed attitude description
([Bergman 1977]: 90--92).

Renard gives the creation year as 1979, but this is the date of the publication
of the English translation of her book *Signed Swedish* but the original
Swedish version was published two years earlier.

# Developments

Fundamental parallels can be observed between the early stages of dance
notation and sign language notation ([Stiedl 2011: 56--92][Stiedl 2011]). Both
share the same origin in the attempt to render movement into writing. In the
20th century, for example, Rudolf von Laban developed Labanotation ([von Laban
1995]), using graphic representations of the movement of different body parts,
arrow-like symbols for directions, and symbols for facial expressions.

A system is considered a script or functional writing system if it is intended
for general usage. Notations, on the other hand, are primarily developed for
academic purposes ([Bentele 2002: 4--15][Bentele 2002], [Coulmas 1996],
[DeFrancis 1989], [Miller 1994: 196ff][Miller 1994]).

The first attempt to record handshapes on paper was made in the 7th century.
These so-called "finger numbers" or "numerical gestures" were not yet an
attempt to write sign languages. Later, in the 16th and 18th centuries, further
attempts were made to teach deaf students spoken language using the "manual
alphabet", "methodical signs", and "sign register". In the 19th century,
Roch-Ambroise Bébian in Paris ([Renard 2004]) and later George Hutton from
Scotland in Nova Scotia ([Hutton 1869: 157--182][Hutton 1869], [Fay 1876:
204--216][Fay 1876](?)) created the first actual sign language writing systems,
both of which were called mimography.

In the 20th century, additional writing systems for sign languages were developed:

* **William Stokoe** developed the **Stokoe Notation** for ASL,
* **Eshkol-Wachmann** created the **Eshkol-Wachmann Movement Notation System** for **Israeli Sign Language**,
* **Paul Jouison** created **D'Sign** for **French Sign Language**,
* **David Rose** developed **AusWrite** for **Australian Sign Language**.

Additionally, based on the Stokoe system, the **Hamburg Notation System
(HamNoSys)** was developed at the University of Hamburg for **German Sign
Language**. [^10]

A phonetic/phonemic system called **SignLettering** (Teuber et al. 1980) was
created by educator **Hartmut Teuber** (USA).

**David J. Peterson** developed an ASCII-compatible phonetic transcription
system for sign languages called the **Sign Language International Phonetic
Alphabet (SLIPA)**. [^12] A wide variety of other sign language writing systems
have also been developed for ASL [^13].

One particularly significant system is **SignWriting**, developed in 1974 by former dancer **Valerie Sutton** [^14]. In German, it is sometimes referred to as **GebärdenSchrift** (with a capital "S" to distinguish it from the general term for sign writing). This system is cross-linguistic and has gained widespread use. Systems such as **si5s** and **ASLwrite** are further developments of SignWriting.

**SignFont**, developed by linguist **Don Newkirk**, is somewhat similar to SignWriting. Its symbols are based on handshapes and are written sequentially from left to right.

**SignScript** [^15] is another writing system developed by a deaf individual. It strongly resembles Sutton SignWriting.

**ASL-phabet** is a modification of Stokoe Notation and SignFont. **ASL Sign Jotting (ASLSJ)** is often used to note down new signs and, like **ASL Orthography** [^16], is easily typeable with a QWERTY keyboard since it uses only standard characters.

In the German-speaking world, systems like **Intersys** (intermediary system,
one symbol = one pictogram) ([Bentele 2002: 76--90][Bentele 2002], [Baier 2001:
430--440][Baier 2001]) and **SOSO** (Sign Oriented Semantic Orthography)
([Bentele 2002: 91--102][Bentele 2002]) have also been developed.

**Gloss transcription** is also commonly used for the written representation of signs.
