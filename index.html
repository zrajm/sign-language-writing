# Sign Language Writing

Glossing is a common practice in sign language research and education. Signs
are typically represented by words from the spoken language, usually written in
all caps, and sometimes with other conventions to describe repetition,
direction or other sign language-only features. Glossing is often used when
teaching sign language to beginners to illustrate grammatical and syntactical
features of sign language.

</summary></details>

I have on several occasions encountered mentions of a pictograph style of sign
language writing used for PISL (Farnell [1995][Farnell 1995]: 244--247, Graber
[2018][Graber 2018]), which seems to often be combined with more logographic
writing.---It is not clear to me how complete this system of writing is, but I
would be greatly amiss if I did not include it on this list.

Graber ([2018][Graber 2018]) describes the shape and meaning of some of these
symbols, as used in a letter in 1890, but, unfortunately, she does not compare
the symbols directly to the corresponding signs in PISL.

> [...] A circle followed by four loops signifies four brothers. Three
> horizontal lines stand for the number three. A box with vertical lines,
> followed by a swooping downward and then upward line, means that someone has
> been buried in a grave. Together, the signs tell Cozad that he no longer had
> four brothers, but only three. One had recently died and been buried.

> Some caution is indeed necessary when dealing with Tomkins' treatment of

> widespread in indigenous North America and served many communicative and
> mnemonic functions, Tomkins may well have invented these "pictographic
> stories" himself. I have not yet come across any other records of stories or
> messages written in the spiral form that Tomkins presents
> ([1926][Tomkins 1926]:89), and he may have taken this idea from Dakota winter
> counts (see Mallery [1886][Mallery 1886] for examples). Most of the
> pictographic "building blocks" used by Tomkins can also be found in the more
> scholarly collections of Schoolcraft and Mallery, however (e.g., SKY as half
> circle in Schoolcraft [1851--1857][Schoolcraft 1851--1857], vol. 1, pp. 390,
> 407; RIVER in Schoolcraft [1851--1857][Schoolcraft 1851--1857], vol. 2, plate
> 57; TRADE in Mallery [1886][Mallery 1886]:220). A good example of a message
> written using pictographs of this kind and written by an Assiniboine person
> can be found in Denig [[1930][Denig 1961]] 1961:603.
>
> Further examples of pictographs representing the movement paths of signs are
> described in Mallery [1886][Mallery 1886]:219--221 and
> [1893][Mallery 1893]:639--641, e.g., PIPE, HUNGER, LITTLE CHIEF, DAKOTA,
> NOON. The only two exceptions to this I have encountered to date are (a) a
> seated human figure signifying "pipe" in which the Dakota artist drew a tiny
> human figure making the sign PIPE instead of drawing a pipe (see Batiste
> Goode's winter count in Mallery [1886][Mallery 1886]:219); and (b) "Afraid of
> Him" a name sign in Red Cloud's census that shows the handshape and arm
> position from the sign AFRAID (Mallery [1886][Mallery 1886]:639). It is
> interesting to note in passing that Dakota pictographs of persons who were
> prisoners are depicted without hands to denote helplessness (Mallery
> [1886][Mallery 1886]:242).

Supalla et al. ([2014][Supalla et al. 2014]: 5) mentions Mimography in a
footnote (spelling it with an superfluous *e*---"Mimeography"). Renard
([2004][Renard 2004]) repeatedly refers to it as "mimographique" which,
presumably, is a more modern French spelling.

| Creator | William Stokoe, with D. Casterline & C. Croneberg
| Country | USA (Gallaudet University)
| Language | Primarily for ASL. It uses letters and numbers for handshapes, combined with conventionalised iconic symbols for location, movement, and spatial relations. It has been adapted and extended for other sign languages, such as BSL and STS
| Estimates for numbers of users today | Predominantly used by linguists and researchers for phonological analysis. It is one of the most widely used notation systems in academic research

FIXME: Renard classifies the Stokoe notation and DASL notation as two different
systems, however I think that's probably not true. I think DASL notation is a
minor development that should probably be described in the Stokoe notation
section, while this section should be removed. This section remains here until
that is verified, however.

It can document all five parameters of sign languages using its specific alphabet, the International SignWriting Alphabet (ISWA 2010). It is a pictorial, bidimensional, and typically vertical writing system. It includes approximately 900 symbols
| Estimates for numbers of users today | In use in many countries (over 40) and was chosen for a preliminary ASL Wikipedia translation. It is considered the "most known and widespread" system and one of the "most promising systems" in Brazil. It is taught in specialized schools in various countries

*Bergman notation* was first described in Bergman ([1977][Bergman 1977]), and
has later been significantly updated and modified, first, by Wallin
([1994][Wallin 1994]), and, then, revised and simplified for broader
non-academic use when the official Swedish Sign Language Lexicon was first
published ([Hedberg 1997]). The transcription is still in use by the online
version of the dictionary ([Svenskt teckenspråkslexikon 2008]). The last guide
to its use is Bergman & Björkstrand ([2015][Bergman & Björkstrand 2015]).
There's also a Unicode font available online ([Zrajm 2017]).

Bergman notation borrows from Stokoe notation, but deviates is several aspects,
among other things it uses Swedish fingerspelling alphabet for the handshapes,
and features a more detailed attitude description ([Bergman 1977]: 90--92).

Renard ([2004][Renard 2004]) gives the creation year as 1979, but this is the
date of the publication of the English translation, not the original Swedish
Bergman ([1977][Bergman 1977]).

Reference section in Bergeron ([2006][Bergeron 2006]) states that Tilkin's
manuscript is unpublished.

The entire description given by Bergeron ([2006][Bergeron 2006]: 7) is:

> With regard to writing systems, they differ from earlier systems in their aim
> of being used regularly by all speakers of a language, rather than solely by
> specialists. In this respect, these systems are comparable to the orthography
> of a spoken language. These systems are explicitly intended to create a
> written modality for a sign language and are developed with that purpose in
> mind. Some proposals, such as that of Gérald Tilkin (Tilkin, manuscript),
> attempt to use the same graphemes as those used for spoken language systems.
> For example, in Tilkin's system, the LSF sign for "écrire" ("to write", as
> illustrated in Moody, 1986) is written as: `s28dd+!F-l7`. The written form of
> this sign reflects the following elements:

> <figcaption>Figure 5: "To write" (in LSF) taken from Moody (1986)</figcaption>

> ![](pic/bergeron2006-fig5.png)
>
> | `s28`: | Handshape /S/ (`s`); variant with the index finger extended (`2`); palm facing downward (`8`)|
> | `dd+`: | Straight movement repeated twice (double `d`); forward direction (`+`) |
> | `!F`:  | Contact from the dominant hand (`!`); with the other hand (`F`) |
> | `-`:   | Hand change |
> | `l7`:  | Non-dominant hand extended, fingers together (`l`); palm facing upward (`7`) |
>
> </figure>
>
> This system is composed of around sixty letters, numbers, and typographic
> symbols divided into seven groups:
>
> * Form-letters (18 letters, each representing a handshape);
> * Movement-letters (9 letters, each representing a type of hand movement);
> * Body-letters (6 letters, each representing a place of articulation);
> * Face-letters (12 letters, each representing a facial expression);
> * Direction-letters (6 characters, including 4 numbers and 2 typographic symbols, each representing a direction);
> * Part-letters (5 numbers which, when combined with body-letters, specify a part of the body);
> * "Other letters" (4 typographic symbols representing hand change, parallelism or symmetry of manual behaviors, or contact).
>
> In Tilkin's system, all associations between graphemes and what he calls
> 'gesture-parts' (that is, a chereme) are entirely arbitrary and have nothing
> to do with the shape of the graphemes or the shape of the cheremes.
