**On "year" above:** "2003" is the copyright year given by Peterson
([2003][Peterson 2003]), however the this statement is the same across all
pages on the web site, and might not accurately reflect the year of the SLIPA
article.---Other sources are also confused about this: Cardoso ([2023][Cardoso
2023]) gives the year as "2000" in multiple places, but as "2003" in the
reference section, while Mendes ([2020][Mendes 2020]) and ASL Font ([2021][ASL
Font 2021]) both specify the year as "2005". (Alas,
[archive.org](https://archive.org) is of no help here, as the first archived
version is from 2009.)
